### Hi there, I'm Anca 👋

#### I'm a software developer who is passionate about ensuring applications solve users’ problems and bring value. 

###### 💻   Ever since I started working in the software industry, I have wanted to be a more instrumental part of the development process. A few years ago, I transitioned from a technical writer into a business analyst role. Then, in January 2020, I was excited to make the commitment to complete the *[Nashville Software School Web Developer Bootcamp](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/)*. It turned out to be the best decision I have made!

###### 💁🏻‍♀️  In addition to my technical skills, I bring a wide variety of soft skills and business experience to the table: ###### - As a former liberal arts major, I have strong communication skills that have served me well throughout my professional career. 
###### - As a technical writer, I ensured user adoption of new features by translating “dev speak” into meaningful workflow documentation that helped users be successful.
###### - As a business analyst, I worked with all the roles in the company - from development to marketing and sales and customer support  - and provided the information they needed to support our customers effectively.

###### 🎯   I recognize that the arc that starts with the backend developer and the UI team stretches through customer support and sales into the user’s routines and that a better understanding of this continuum makes for more effective and impactful software.
