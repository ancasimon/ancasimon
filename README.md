### Hi there, I'm Anca 👋

#### *I'm a software developer who is passionate about ensuring applications solve users’ problems and bring value.* 
###### You can check out my portfolio [here](https://asimonbio.firebaseapp.com/) and find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anca-simon/) as well. 

#####   💻 The ability to help solve big - and small - problems is what has drawn me to the software development role. A few years ago, I transitioned from a technical writer into a business analyst role. Then, in January 2020, I was excited to make the commitment to complete the *[Nashville Software School Web Developer Bootcamp](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/)*. It turned out to be the best decision I made - in a year otherwise full of surprises! I graduated from NSS on January 12, 2021 and am actively searching for an organization where I can combine my previous experience and new technical skills to make meaningful contributions. 
##### 💁🏻‍♀️  In addition to my technical skills, I bring a wide variety of soft skills and business experience to the table. As a former liberal arts major, I have strong communication skills that have served me well throughout my professional career. As a technical writer, I ensured user adoption of new features by translating “dev speak” into meaningful documentation. As a business analyst, I collaborated with all roles to ensure our products, our teams, and our customers were successful.
##### 🎯  I recognize that the arc that starts with the backend developer and the UI team stretches through customer support and sales into the user’s routines and that a better understanding of this continuum makes for more effective and impactful software.


#### Latest Projects
* ###### Right now: Getting an introduction to Python with the ***Python Crash Course, A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming*** by Eric Matthes. Loving its straight-forward syntax!
* ###### December 2020: My final capstone project at the Nashville Software School: [Unlimited](https://github.com/ancasimon/backend-capstone) - A full-stack CRUD application built with C#, ASP .NET Core MVC, SQL database, HTTP-based APIs, and a single-page React application with Firebase authentication. A one-stop shop where parents of young budding musicians can create custom practice plans, browse games from the database, filter them based on their child's age and instrument, and track progress. It will make them want to practice!
* ###### October 2020: <img src="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/assets/HF-full-logo-b05d5eb32b3f3ecc9b2240526104cf4da3187b8b61963dd9042fdc2536e4a76c.svg" alst="Hacktoberfest logo" width="150" />
* ###### Summer 2020: [GearUp!](https://github.com/ancasimon/front-end-capstone), my frontend capstone project - take a quick look, and you will be able to tell I was so excited to work on this project!
