### Hi there, I'm Anca 👋

I'm a software developer who is passionate about ensuring applications solve users’ problems and bring value. 


Ever since I started working in the software industry, I have wanted to be a more instrumental part of the development process. A few years ago, I transitioned from a technical writer into a business analyst role, and then this year, I was excited to make the commitment to complete the Nashville Software School Web Developer bootcamp. It turned out to be the best decision I have made - especially in a year that turned out to be full of surprises. 


In addition to my technical skills, I bring a wide variety of soft skills and business experience to the table. As a former liberal arts major, I have strong communication skills that have served me well throughout my professional career. As a technical writer, I ensured user adoption of new features by translating “dev speak” into meaningful workflow documentation that helped users be successful. As a business analyst, I worked with all the roles in the company - from development to marketing and sales and customer support  - and provided the information they needed to support our customers effectively.


I understand the arc that starts in software development and then continues through customer support and sales into the user’s routines and how a better understanding of this continuum makes for better software.
