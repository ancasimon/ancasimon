### Hi there, I'm Anca 👋

#### I'm a software developer who is passionate about ensuring applications solve users’ problems and bring value.

A few years ago, I transitioned from a technical writer into a business analyst role. Then, in January 2020, I was excited to make the commitment to complete the *[Nashville Software School Web Developer Bootcamp](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/)*. It turned out to be the best decision I made in a year otherwise full of surprises!

###### 💁🏻‍♀️  In addition to my technical skills, I bring a wide variety of soft skills and business experience to the table. As a former liberal arts major, I have strong communication skills that have served me well throughout my professional career. As a technical writer, I ensured user adoption of new features by translating “dev speak” into meaningful documentation. As a business analyst, I collaborated with all roles to ensure our products, our teams, and our customers were successful.

###### 🎯   I recognize that the arc that starts with the backend developer and the UI team stretches through customer support and sales into the user’s routines and that a better understanding of this continuum makes for more effective and impactful software.
